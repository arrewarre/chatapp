NotebookLM is an AI-powered research assistant developed by Google. It allows users to upload documents (PDFs, text files, etc.) and then asks questions about them.
Key features include:
1. Source grounding: Answers are based strictly on uploaded content.
2. Citations: It provides references to where information was found.
3. Audio Overview: It can generate a podcast-style conversation about the sources.
4. Privacy: Data is not used to train the base model.
NotebookLM mimics a virtual research assistant that helps synthesize information.
